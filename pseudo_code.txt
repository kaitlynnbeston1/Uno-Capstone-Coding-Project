Classes needed


Card class:
	Will need color (Red, green, blue, yellow), value (Number, draw 2, wild, wild draw 4, skip), and points value.


Will most likely need a deck class.


Piles will need to be represented as well. EX: discard pile, draw card, and hand would all be subclasses since they are groups of cards. 


Player class will handle things such as drawing cards and keeping score. Will also need Boolean value to track whether a player has Uno. I also think they will need to have player numbers to dictate who’s turn is when.


Variables
Turn_number = 0


Functions
I am not quite sure where each function will go, but as of now thinking all card and score stuff will go in the player class.


Player


Draw_card():
	Take card from deck class
	Card gets moved into player’s hand.
Can only draw once. Turn skipped after if no playable cards.


Play_card(card):
	If card is playable:
		Move card from hand to discard pile when user selects said card.
	else:
		Tell user they have no playable cards.
		Wait for them to draw a card
		if playable card is drawn:
			Wait for user to play card
			User plays card and next person’s turn.
		else:
			Move to next person’s turn.


Say_uno():
	if there is one card in the deck:
		Print a message saying that the player said Uno
	else:
Tell the player that they cannot say Uno right now and they must wait until they have one card.


Catch_uno():
	Look at the hands of players
	if player other than one playing has Uno:
		Say that player X caught player y for not saying Uno.
	else:
		Say that no one has Uno.


Full_uno():
	if player has Uno:
		Say_uno()
	else:
		catch_uno()


draw_two():
	[player.draw_card() for card in range(0, 3]


Draw_four():
	[player.draw_card for card in range[0, 5)]



Deck


Refresh_draw():
	if draw pile is empty:
Cards from discard move over to draw
	else:
		Put in error message for myself. That shouldn’t happen.


Change_color():
	Ask user for color
	Top card becomes “wild as {color}”


Misc


Whos_turn():
	If turn number matches player number:
		That player takes their turn.
	IF number is greater than the max number of players:
		Turn number gets set to 0.


Take_turn():
	If it is your turn:
	Ask user for which card they would like to draw
	Your_name.play_card(chosen card)
