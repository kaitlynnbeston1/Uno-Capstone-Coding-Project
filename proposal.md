# CS30 Final Project Proposal

For my project, I have decided to create an Uno game. This project will be completed individually.

## Must-have features

- Ability to play against another human
- Deck of cards
- Each player must start with 7 cards at the beginning of a round.
- Ability to keep track of whether cards have been discarded
- Number of cards in hand, discard, and unplayed cards must be tracked
- Wild cards functional and work as expected
- Accessible with screen readers
- must only be able to play cards with the same number or color
- Must be able to catch your opponent for not saying uno
- Must have the ability to say uno
- Ability to play one round and get winner's score
- Discard pile must shuffle when draw pile reaches 0
- Ability to see the top card of discard pile

## Nice to have

- Ability to play with AI/bot
- Pretty user interface
- Sounds for game actions using Winsound from standard lib
- ability to have more than two players, either bot or human
- keeping track of high scores
- multiple rounds and score tracking
- online play (Very far into the future, like after this class. Something to work on though.)

## Has this been done before?

I have played several accessible Uno games on sites such as RS games or QuentonCâ€™s Playroom, but they all had 0 graphics for sighted people. There are also various Uno games that only have graphics, but someone who uses a screen reader would not be able to play. So what I am doing has been done in different ways, but never the way I am doing it or want to do it.

## Target user

My target user is anyone who enjoys card games. Also people who are looking for accessible games that sighted people can also enjoy.
